An [open-source](https://github.com/heroiclabs/fishgame-godot) combat game made with [Godot](http://godotengine.org/)! The game's developers have also made an open-source game server [here](https://heroiclabs.com/)! [Gamecom.io](https://gamecom.io/) hosts an instance of this server with our version of the game.

Join in, invite a friend, and have fun! We will be doing a lot with this between Gamecom and [@modcommunity](https://github.com/modcommunity) along with many other future games to come!

Use **W**, **S**, **A**, **D** to move. Use **E** to pick up weapons and **Q** to attack.
